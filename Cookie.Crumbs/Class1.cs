    The Cookie Crumbs library represents a shared library of classes
    that are useful to have definitions for in every project, being
    backend and UI.

    Generally, this provides a basic datasource/format that allows clear state
    synchronization between the Client and Server snapshots of Model/ViewModel
    application state. **All** Client/Server IO can be abstracted through this
    library, though this library is designed agnostically to how they may
    choose to communicate the relevant information.
